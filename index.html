                    <p>I served as a programming instructor for the TreeTree2 Afterschool's Program which is a
                        program with various courses, that encourages students of many ages to delve into 
                        subjects that are not presented early in school. All of the content provided by 
                        these courses is created by teachers, engineers, investigators and the highest 
                        callibre of students that the country has to offer.
                        <p>
                            The course I participated on was Programming, where our goal was to teach all 
                            the first steps into becoming an elite class programmer.

                    <p>
                        My name is Hugo Silva and I was born and raised in Madeira Island, Portugal. I moved to Lisbon in 2020
                        in order to proceed my studies in Computer Science and Engineering at Instituto Superior Técnico.
                        Currently, I am studying Data Science and AI at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg.
                    <p>
                        I consider myself a very versatile and adaptable person, which is why I have always been interested
                        in many different fields. From outdoor activities to indoor ones, I have, since ever, been curious
                        to try out as many areas as possible. I love learning and my goal in life is to be capable of doing
                        as many things as possible, whether it be in the field of technology, sports, music or anything else.
                    <p>
                        I played football up until 7th grade quite competitively, but nowadays I am trying out new sports like
                        skating. Music plays a key role in everyone's life and I am no exception. Recently, in 2019,
                        I decided to pick up the guitar and start learning it by myself and now it is an essential part of my
                        daily life.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am ambitious and dedicated. Everything that I put my mind into, I will do my absolute best 
                        to achieve it. I do not back out of a challenge and most importantly, I am teachable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Regarding my professional life, my main interest is AI and Machine Learning. In 2022 I took
                        a course on Machine Learning which caught the whole of my attention. Everything about it interests
                        me and I could not be more excited to further deepen my knoweldge in this field.
